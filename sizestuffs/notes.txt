p1 is 41KB in size, which probably implies this is the basic size of these cpp exe files

p1 speicific size : 41,664 bytes

p1.c is created
p1_c is the corresponding exe file, p1.c is just p1.cpp but in c format

p1_c specific size : 41,664 bytes

huh, both have same goddahmn size


int size = 20000000;

with this, while statically allocated, the program crashes
but when dynamically allocated, it doesnt
