pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb

use this command in msys2 ucrt bash first


C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin

keep this path on top or it wont affect anything

if you remove this path, it will change the output but you need to first restart the goddamn ide
with no MinGw path it wont run, prolly

--need to remove both path for it to not work--


add that path before the MinGw thing

before msys2 : pointer size shown 4 bytes
                int size 4 bytes
after msys2  : pointer size shown 8bytes
                int size 4 bytes
