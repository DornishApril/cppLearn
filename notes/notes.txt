pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb

use this command in msys2 ucrt bash first


C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin 

if you remove this path, it will change the output but you need to first restart the goddamn ide
with no MinGw path it wont run, prolly

--will stay as it is if it doesnt run after MinGw is removed--

add that path before the MinGw thing

before msys2 : pointer size shown 4 bytes
                int size 4 bytes
after msys2  : pointer size shown 8bytes
                int size 4 bytes
